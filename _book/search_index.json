The data are in the file named larain. xyplot(larain, ylab = &quot;Inches&quot;, xlab = &quot;Year&quot;, type = &quot;o&quot;) 1.2 Colors Produce the time series plot displayed in Exhibit 1.3, on page 3. The data file is named color. data(color) xyplot(color, ylab = &quot;Color property&quot;, xlab = &quot;Batch&quot;, type = &quot;o&quot;) 1.3 Random, normal time series Simulate a completely random process of length 48 with independent, normal values. Plot the time series plot. Does it look “random”? Repeat this exercise several times with a new simulation each time. xyplot(as.ts(rnorm(48))) xyplot(as.ts(rnorm(48))) As far as we can tell there is no discernable pattern here. 1.4 Random, \\(\\chi^2\\)-distributed time series Simulate a completely random process of length 48 with independent, chi-square distributed values, each with 2 degrees of freedom. Display the time series plot. Does it look “random” and nonnormal? Repeat this exercise several times with a new simulation each time. xyplot(as.ts(rchisq(48, 2))) xyplot(as.ts(rchisq(48, 2))) "]
